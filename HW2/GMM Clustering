GMM Clustering and Comparison with K-Means Clustering.

The Kmeans clustering and GMM clustering showed same cluster plots for the Air Pollution Dataset.
The AQI index was calculated for the Dataset's PM25 and PM10 value and plotted against 'o3' and 'so2' values using Sklearn's KMeans and GMM model.
